      <ProjectCard
        title="Customer Operations at Scale"
        description="Managed customer communication workflows handling 17,000+ messages annually. Built ticketing systems, documentation, and support processes that established a scalable foundation for client support."

      <ProjectCard
        title="The Connector Hub"
        description="Built The Connector Hub, a comprehensive Notion workspace at Advekit to solve communication bottlenecks in our remote company. Customer success was getting held up by lack of inter-department communication, so I created this centralized Notion hub where all client information was documented and accessible to every department on their own time. This eliminated waiting dependencies, boosted operational efficiency, and improved team collaboration, driving improvements in client retention and sales revenue."
