      <ProjectCard
        title="Front AI Drafter"
        description="Support volume grew 4x in six months. I needed a scalable solution to handle the growth on my own, so I implemented an AI system that categorizes messages and drafts contextual replies, achieving 98%+ accuracy through iterative testing."

      <ProjectCard
        title="Customer Operations at Scale"
        description="Managed customer comms, handling 17,000+ messages annually across Front, Notion, and our admin platform. Built the ticketing systems, documentation, and processes that made high-volume support sustainable.\n\nCreated a Notion template library so anyone on the team could handle common client questions. Ran Customer.io campaigns for mass candidate updates and stayed responsive on mobile, not just desktop."

      <ProjectCard
        title="The Connector Hub"
        description="Created a company-wide Notion workspace at Advekit to solve cross-department communication bottlenecks. As a remote-first company, teams were waiting on each other for client information, causing delays in customer success.\n\nThe hub centralized client data so all departments could access and update it in real-time, eliminating delays and significantly improving response times. This drove measurable improvements in client retention and sales revenue."
