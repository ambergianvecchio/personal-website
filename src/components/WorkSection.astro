      <ProjectCard
        title="Front AI Drafter"
        description="Support volume grew 4x in six months. I needed a scalable solution to handle the growth on my own, so I implemented an AI system that categorizes messages and drafts contextual replies, achieving 98%+ accuracy through iterative testing."

      <ProjectCard
        title="From Feedback to Features"
        description="Created systematic feedback infrastructure to capture and categorize member signals daily. Built a 30+ category tracking system and implemented AI-powered tagging as volume scaled.\n\nIdentified patterns that informed product priorities, turning reactive support into proactive improvement while maintaining under 16hr avg resolution through 4x growth."

      <ProjectCard
        title="Customer Operations at Scale"
        description="Turned tribal knowledge into documented systems. Built 80+ templates and knowledge base articles in Notion covering FAQs, edge cases, and multi-step workflows requiring data from five different tools. These templates became the foundation for knowledge bases in Front and Claude, enabling consistent responses across every channel.\n\nCreated the tagging taxonomy that later powered AI automation. Systems designed to scale."

      <ProjectCard
        title="The Connector Hub"
        description="Created a company-wide Notion workspace at Advekit to solve cross-department communication bottlenecks. As a remote-first company, teams were waiting on each other for client information, causing delays in customer success.\n\nThe hub centralized client data so all departments could access and update it in real-time, eliminating delays and significantly improving response times. This drove measurable improvements in client retention and sales revenue."
