      <ProjectCard
        title="Front AI Drafter"
        description="As support volume grew, I saw an opportunity to build. I designed an AI system that understands context the way I would, categorizing messages and drafting replies that match our voice. The key was iterative testing until it felt right."

      <ProjectCard
        title="From Feedback to Features"
        description="I noticed we were solving the same problems repeatedly without learning from them. So I built a system to capture and categorize every member interaction, not just to respond faster, but to surface patterns product could act on.\n\nThe goal was turning support from a cost center into a feedback loop. When I spotted recurring friction, I could bring data to product conversations instead of just anecdotes."

      <ProjectCard
        title="Customer Ops at Scale"
        description="The knowledge lived in my head, which meant I was a bottleneck. I documented everything: not just answers, but the thinking behind them. Edge cases, multi-step workflows, when to escalate.\n\nThe goal was making myself replaceable in the best way: anyone could step in and maintain quality. These docs later became the foundation for our AI system."

      <ProjectCard
        title="The Connector Hub"
        description="Remote teams kept waiting on each other for basic client information. The problem wasn't communication, it was that knowledge was siloed by department.\n\nI built a central Notion workspace where everyone could access and update client data in real-time. It became the single source of truth across ops, customer success, and billing."
