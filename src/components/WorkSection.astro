        title="Front AI Drafter"
        description="Built an AI system that categorizes incoming support messages and drafts replies using OpenAI's Agents SDK. Got it to 98%+ accuracy through a lot of testing and prompt iteration."

      <ProjectCard
        title="Customer Operations at Scale"
        description="Managed customer comms handling 17,000+ messages a year. Built the ticketing systems, docs, and processes that made it actually manageable."

      <ProjectCard
        title="The Connector Hub"
        description="Created a company-wide Notion workspace at Advekit to solve cross-department communication bottlenecks. As a remote-first company, teams were waiting on each other for client information, causing delays in customer success.\n\nThe hub centralized client data so all departments could access and update it in real-time, eliminating delays and significantly improving response times. This drove measurable improvements in client retention and sales revenue."
